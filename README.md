# Linear Regression Project: Monthly Revenue Prediction for Restaurants

## Objective

This training project aims to predict the monthly revenue of restaurants using linear regression. The project is designed for educational purposes, providing insights into building and evaluating a predictive model based on historical business data.

## Data

In this project, we work with a dataset that includes various features related to restaurant operations. The data includes the following features:

- **Number_of_Customers**: The number of customers visiting the restaurant.
- **Menu_Price**: The average price of items on the menu.
- **Marketing_Spend**: The amount spent on marketing and advertising.
- **Average_Customer_Spending**: The average spending of a customer per visit.
- **Promotions**: The number or type of promotional offers active during the month.
- **Reviews**: Customer reviews or ratings of the restaurant.
- **Monthly_Revenue**: The total revenue generated by the restaurant in a month (target variable).

*Note: The dataset used in this project is for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world business scenarios.*

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Building**: Developed models including:
  - **Linear Regression**: Basic model to establish a performance baseline.
  - **Polynomial Regression**: Explored higher-order relationships by considering polynomial features.
  - **Ridge Regression**: Applied L2 regularization to handle potential multicollinearity.
  - **Lasso Regression**: Applied L1 regularization for feature selection and to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of each model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the training, cross-validation, and testing sets. Conducted residual analysis to evaluate the model's assumptions. Linear Regression performed best on the test set with the lowest MSE, while Ridge and Lasso did not offer significant improvements.
